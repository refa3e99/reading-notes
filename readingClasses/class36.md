## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

- Take a few minutes.

What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem.

- Write down the steps of the solution.

Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

- Write pseudocode first.

Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.

- Don’t sweat the small stuff.

Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

- Sit down. Be humble.

A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.

- Come prepared.

When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.

- Review your work.

You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible.
