## Notes about Lists Comprehensions
- List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
- In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
- More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.
- Writing compact code is essential for maintaining programs and working with teams. 
- Learning to make use of advanced features like list comprehension will save time and improve productivity like when we want
to create a list of digits by using the ``` range() ``` inside the list, Create a List Using Loops and List Comprehension in Python,
Comparing list creation methods in Python, Multiplication with list comprehensions create a list with list comprehension.
- List comprehensions can make solving issues involving strings much easier using simplified expressions. These methods can save time and precious lines of code.
Using list comprehension to loop through a string in Python, it’s possible to convert strings from lower case to upper case, and vice versa. 

- Making use of Python’s ```lower()``` and ```upper()``` methods, we’ll use list comprehension to achieve this common task.
- Using list comprehension to loop through a string in Python, it’s possible to convert strings from lower case to upper case, and vice versa. 

- Making use of Python’s ```lower()``` and ```upper()``` methods, we’ll use list comprehension to achieve this common task.
- Another interesting exercise is to extract numbers from a string. For example, we may have a database of names and phone numbers.

- It would be useful if we could separate the phone numbers from the names. Using list comprehensions, we can do just that.

- Taking advantage of Python’s ```isdigit()``` method, we can extract the phone number from the user data.
It’s also possible to read files in Python using list comprehension.
