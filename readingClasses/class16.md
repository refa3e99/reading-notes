## What is Serverless?
#### Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider. The cloud provider handles the rest, provisioning the cloud infrastructure required to run the code and scaling the infrastructure up and down on demand as needed. The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.

Also important: With serverless, developers never pay for idle capacity. The cloud provider spins up and provisions the required computing resources on demand when the code executes, and spins them back down again—called ‘scaling to zero’—when execution stops. The billing starts when execution starts, and ends when execution stops; typically, pricing is based on execution time and resources required.
