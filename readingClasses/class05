## i used a cheat sheet
## big O
Big O(oh) notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on 2 factors:

Running Time (also known as time efficiency / complexity)

The amount of time a function needs to complete.

Memory Space (also known as space efficiency / complexity)

The amount of memory resources a function uses to store data and instructions.

Big O: The worst case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
Running Time: The amount of time required for an algorithm to complete.
Memory Space: The amount of memory resources required for an algorithm to complete.
Input Size: Represented by the variable n, the total size of values used as parameters in an algorithm.
Big Omega: The best case analysis of algorithm efficiency.
Big Theta: The typical or random case used for analysis of algorithm efficiency.

## Linked list
Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
