Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
Django was originally developed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss. The code was open-sourced in 2005 and developers immediately started making contributions to the codebase. Fourteen years later, Django remains under active development, with new major releases every nine months, minor security releases almost monthly, an official issue tracker, and robust discussion on the django-developers Google group.
As a result, almost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

- 1) **Corporate Sponsor** - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at times.

- 2) **Solo** - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid consulting services.

- 3) **Non-profit** - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.

### Conclusion
So where does this Django behind the scenes tour leave us? Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.

One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person.
