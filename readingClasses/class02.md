## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.
One of the things that amaze me about TDD is how we can grow our software design consciously and well, just building what is needed to make the test pass. When we are writing tests we are forced to think about the design first and how we can break it into small pieces.
## If name equals main
Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables. 
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”. If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. 
## Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function. Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
