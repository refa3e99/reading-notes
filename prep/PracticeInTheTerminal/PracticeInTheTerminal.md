# Practice In the Terminal

I learned about the command line and how to deal with it,
how it works and how to get to one.
After that how to navigate through the files and using some commands
to know where i am in the files -my path-.
How to deal with files and doing some operations like creating a file,
remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.
